				Well, analyzing big heap dumps can also require more heap space.
				Give it
				some more memory (possible by running on a 64-bit machine):
			</p>


			<samp class="ph codeph">MemoryAnalyzer.exe -vmargs -Xmx4g</samp>

			<p class="p">Alternatively, edit the MemoryAnalyzer.ini to
				contain:</p>

				For more details, check out the section
				<a class="xref" href="http://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm">Running Eclipse</a>
				in the Help Center. It also contains more details if you are running
				on Mac OS X.
			</p>


			<p class="p">If you are running the Memory Analyzer inside your Eclipse SDK,
				you need to edit the eclipse.ini file.</p>


			<div class="p">The memory intensive parts are the parsing of the dump and building
				of the dominator tree. Try parsing the heap
				dump from the command line, perhaps on a bigger machine. The dumps
				and index files can then be copied to a more convenient machine. 
				Once the dump has been parsed, it usually can
				be opened with less memory in the GUI.
				As a rough estimate if the number of objects is N and the number of 
				classes C, it might take at least T bytes to parse and build the dominator tree
				where:
				<p class="lines">T ≈ N * 28.25 + C * 1000 + P</p>

				P is the space used by the DTFJ or HPROF parsers. For a PHD file, the space could be:
				<p class="lines">P ≈ C * 1000</p>

				Memory Analyzer uses additional memory for caching index files, so
				performance will be better if there is more memory available than the minimum
				required to parse a dump.
				</div>

				<p class="p">Memory Analyzer has an architectural limit of 2<sup class="ph sup">31</sup> - 3 objects,
				a current limit of 2<sup class="ph sup">31</sup> - 8 = 2,147,483,640 objects, but has not been
				tested with that many objects. The current record is a heap dump file of 70Gbytes
				containing 1,160,000,000 objects, which was opened with Memory Analyzer running
				with a 64Gbyte heap.</p>
