				Memory Analyzer provides several queries to inspect the threads at the 
				moment the snapshot was taken.
			</p>

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Threads Overview</strong></p>

			<p class="p">
				To get an overview of all the threads in the heap dump, use the "Thread Overview" button
				in the toolbar, as shown on the image below. Alternatively one could use the 
				<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Query Browser</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Thread Overview and Stacks</span></span>
				query:
			</p>

			<img class="image" src="../mimes/threads_overview.png" alt="screen shot of thread overview" />
			<p class="p">
				The query provide some properties like thread name, thread object, Context Classloader, and more
				for each of the threads.
			</p>

			<div class="p">
				Some heap dump formats (e.g. HPROF dumps from recent Java 6 VMs and IBM system dumps)
				contain information about the call stacks of threads, and the Java local objects per 
				stack frame. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Max. Locals' Retained Heap</span> column shows the maximum retained
				heap of each stack frame's locals which helps quickly explore why a thread is retaining
				a lot of heap. When a stack frame is the first selected item the <span class="keyword wintitle">Inspector</span> view shows the class of the
				method of the frame.
				The context menu for a stack frame operates on the locals in that frame,
				and so calculating the precise or approximate retained size when stack frames are selected
				shows how much memory each stack frame is retaining, or equivalently how much memory would
				be freed if all the locals of that frame were cleared.
				<ol class="ol">
					<li class="li">Select all threads using <span class="ph uicontrol">ctrl+A</span> or <span class="ph uicontrol">command+A</span></li>

					<li class="li">Expand one level with <span class="ph uicontrol">shift+numpad-plus</span></li>

					<li class="li">Select all threads and stack frames using <span class="ph uicontrol">ctrl+A</span> or <span class="ph uicontrol">command+A</span></li>

					<li class="li">Calculate retained size using one of the toolbar items
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Calculate Minimum Retained Size (quick approx.)</span>
					or <span class="ph uicontrol">Calculate Precise Retained Size</span></li>

					<li class="li">Find the far right hand column <span class="ph uicontrol">Retained Size</span></li>

					<li class="li">Move it to somewhere more convenient by 
					dragging the column header or by clicking on the filter cell,
					then using <span class="ph uicontrol">shift+up-arrow</span></li>

					<li class="li">Sort on the column</li>

					<li class="li">Examine the stack frames retaining the most memory</li>

			<p class="p">
				Exploring the call-stacks and the local Java objects is a powerful feature, giving a
				debugger like capabilities over a snapshot. It allows analyzing in detail the reasons
				for memory intensive operations. It also allow using Memory Analyzer
				not only for memory-related problems, but also for a wide range of other problems 
				such as unresponsive applications.
			</p>

			
			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Threads Details</strong></p>
			
			<p class="p">
				You can proceed with the analysis of a single thread by using the
				<span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Java Basics</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Thread Details</span></span>
				context menu. Memory Analyzer provides an extension point such that extensions can
				provide semantic information about the thread's activity. The result of the Thread Details 
				query will contain such information (if available), some overview information, and 
				possibly the stacktrace of the thread.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
				For DTFJ based dumps (IBM system dumps and IBM PHD files with associated java dump) the thread
				details view gives more information, including the thread state, priority and native stack trace.

			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Threads Stacks in Dumps from IBM VMs and HPROF Dumps</strong></p>
	
			<div class="p">The DTFJ parser and HPROF parser provide more control over viewing thread stacks. This is configured using the 
			DTFJ Parser or HPROF Parser preferences page. The options are as follows:
			<dl class="dl">
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm">Normal</dt>

				<dd class="dd">Stack frames are only shown in the thread stacks view.</dd>

			
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm">Only stack frames as pseudo-objects</dt>

				<dd class="dd">Stack frames are shown in all views such as paths to GC roots, outbound references from threads, as pseudo-objects.
				Local variables references in the stack frames are shown as outbound references from the frame.
				This makes it easy to find which stack frames keep objects alive. For DTFJ, the size of the stack frame is the
				size on the Java stack, not the heap. HPROF stack frames have zero size.</dd>

			
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm">Stack frames as pseudo-objects and running methods as pseudo-classes</dt>

				<dd class="dd">Stack frames are shown in all views such as paths to GC roots, outbound references from threads, as pseudo-objects.
				Local variables references in the stack frames are shown as outbound references from the frame.
				This makes it easy to find which stack frames keep objects alive. 
				The stack frames are given a pseudo-type depending based on the method which is running in the frame.
				By viewing the number of instances of that pseudo-type it is easy to see which methods are running across
				all the threads and which methods use a lot of stack. This can help solve StackOverflowErrors.</dd>

			
			
				<dt class="dt dlterm">Stack frames as pseudo-objects and all methods as pseudo-classes</dt>

				<dd class="dd">Only available with the DTFJ Parser. Stack frames are shown in all views such as paths to GC roots, outbound references from threads, as pseudo-objects.
				Local variables references in the stack frames are shown as outbound references from the frame.
				This makes it easy to find which stack frames keep objects alive. 
				The stack frames are given a pseudo-type depending based on the method which is running in the frame.
				By viewing the number of instances of that pseudo-type it is easy to see which methods are running across
				all the threads and which methods use a lot of stack. This can help solve StackOverflowErrors.
				All other methods are also created as pseudo-class objects. The size of the method pseudo-class object is
				the size of the byte code and JITted code, which in other modes is accumulated into the size of the
				defining class. This makes it easy to find methods which consume a lot of non-heap memory for byte code
				and JITted code.</dd>
