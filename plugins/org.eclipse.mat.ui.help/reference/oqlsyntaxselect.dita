			<p>
				The <codeph>SELECT</codeph> clause determines what to extract from the
				heap dump. To display objects and be able to browse the
				outgoing references, use the
				<codeph>*</codeph>
				symbol:
			</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT * FROM java.lang.String</codeblock>

			<p><b>Select specific columns</b></p>
			<p>
				Alternatively, one can select the fields to be
				displayed:
			</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT toString(s), s.count, s.value FROM java.lang.String s</codeblock>
			<p>
				The resulting table knows about the underlying object.
				So you can use the context menu to open further views on
				the object at hand. Use the <codeph>@</codeph> symbol to access Java
				attributes and methods of the objects. There are also a
				number of built-in functions available to extract common
				information:
			</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT toString(s), s.@usedHeapSize,
    s.@retainedHeapSize FROM java.lang.String s</codeblock>
			<p>
				The section on
				<xref href="propertyaccessors.dita">
					Property Accessors
				</xref>
				contains details on the commonly available attributes.
			</p>
			<p><b>Provide column names</b></p>
			<p>Use the AS keyword to name the columns:</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT toString(s) AS Value,
    s.@usedHeapSize AS "Shallow Size",
    s.@retainedHeapSize AS "Retained Size"
			FROM java.lang.String s</codeblock>
			<p>
				Use the
				<codeph>AS RETAINED SET</codeph>
				keyword to get the set of objects retained by your
				selection:
			</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT AS RETAINED SET * FROM java.lang.String</codeblock>
			<p><b>Flatten select items into an object list</b></p>
			<p>
				Use the
				<codeph>OBJECTS</codeph>
				to interpret the items in the
				<codeph>SELECT</codeph>
				clause as objects:
			</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT OBJECTS dominators(s) FROM java.lang.String s</codeblock>
			<p>
				The function
				<codeph>dominators()</codeph>
				returns an array of objects. Therefore the query returns
				a list of object lists, i.e. arrays. By using the
				keyword
				<codeph>OBJECTS</codeph>
				, we force the OQL to reduce this into a single list of
				objects.
			</p>
			<p><b>Select unique objects</b></p>
			<p>
				Use the
				<codeph>DISTINCT</codeph>
				keyword to only select unique objects:
			</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT DISTINCT * FROM OBJECTS 0,1,1,2</codeblock>
			<p>
				Use the
				<codeph>DISTINCT OBJECTS</codeph>
				keyword to only select unique objects from the result of the selected clause:
			</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT DISTINCT OBJECTS classof(s) FROM java.lang.String s</codeblock>
			<p>
				The function
				<codeph>classof</codeph>
				returns the class object. Of course, all Strings have
				the same class. The <codeph>OBJECTS</codeph> converts the underlying row with a String object
				and a displayed value of the class object
				to the object represented by the result of the <codeph>classof</codeph> function.
				Without the <codeph>DISTINCT OBJECTS</codeph>
				keywords, the query would result in a list with as many
				rows with the same class as there are Strings.
			</p>
			<p>With Memory Analyzer 1.10 or later, <codeph>DISTINCT</codeph> also operates without
			<codeph>OBJECTS</codeph> to find items which are distinct.
			See <xref format="html" scope="peer" href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/MemoryAnalyzer/OQL#SELECT_DISTINCT">Wiki: OQL SELECT DISTINCT</xref>
			for further details.</p>
			<p><b>Expressions (experimental, Memory Analyzer 1.4 or later)</b></p>
			<p>
				Use the expressions for the select item, including string concatenation:
			</p>
			<codeblock>SELECT s.@objectId, s.@objectId * 2, "The object ID is "+@objectId FROM OBJECTS 0,1,1,2 s</codeblock>
			<p>
				With Memory Analyzer 1.4 or later expressions and sub-selects are allowed for select items. More complex
				expressions may need to be parenthesized. This is currently in the test phase.
