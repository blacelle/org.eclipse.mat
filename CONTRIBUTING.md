Contributing a patch
--------------------

The MAT repositories are accessed through Gerrit, the code review
project, which makes it possible for anybody to clone the repository, make
changes and push them back for review and eventual acceptance into the project.

Before your first contribution can be accepted, you need to electronically sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php) (ECA). Find more information in the ECA [FAQ](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ecafaq.php).

Find more details about how to contribute in:
- [Development Resources/Contributing via Git](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git)
- [Development Resources/Handling Git Contributions](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Handling_Git_Contributions)

Once the patch is pushed back to Gerrit, the project committers will be
informed and they will undertake a review of the code. The patch may need
modifying for some reason. In order to make amending commits more
straightforward, the steps at
https://git.eclipse.org/r/Documentation/cmd-hook-commit-msg.html should be
followed. This automatically inserts a "Change-Id" entry to your commit message
which allows you to amend commits and have Gerrit track them as the same
change.

What happens next depends on the content of the patch. If it is 100% authored
by the contributor and is less than 1000 lines (and meets the needs of the
project), then it can be committed to the main repository. If not, more steps
are required. These are detailed in the legal process poster:
